Sound marked one, kick-gettinglaid plays first, followed by two clp-dust808. These make up the beat samples for levels. A nice bassy beat, and clap make a nice rhythmic beat without being too repetetive. Sound one is licensed under Creative Commons Zero Attribution, so no licensing is needed. Sound 2 is under Creative Commons Attribution licence (though the creator's description claims we don't need to attribute him). To cover our ass, if used, this sound is created by freesound.org user DWSD and is found at this link.
